DataExample             Example of results that can be obtained with
                        package odprism
odprim                  Simulation function to asses the optimal design
                        (balanced datasets) for studies planning to use
                        random intercept models to analyze their data.
odprism-package         The package 'odprism' can be used to determine
                        the Optimal Design and Performane of Random
                        Intercept and Slope Models
odprismB                Simulation function to asses the optimal design
                        (balanced datasets) for studies planning to use
                        random intercept and slopes models to analyze
                        their data.
odprismU                Simulation function to asses the optimal design
                        (unbalanced datasets) for studies planning to
                        use random intercept and slopes models to
                        analyze their data consiting of annually
                        measured traits.
plot2d.prism            Function to plot the performance (accuracy,
                        precision and statistical power) as a function
                        of the number of individuals (x-axis) and
                        replicates (y-axis) sampled.
